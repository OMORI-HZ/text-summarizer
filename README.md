You'll need to install the necessary libraries first if you haven't already:
```pip install nltk gensi```
```pip install nltk gensim```
Download necessary NLTK data:
The script automatically downloads the required NLTK data (punkt), which is necessary for sentence tokenization.

Save the script to a Python file (e.g., text_summarizer.py).

Prepare a text file you want to summarize and note its path (e.g., path_to_your_text_file.txt).

NOW RUN THE SCRIPT

file_path = 'path_to_your_text_file.txt'
summary = summarize_text(file_path, summary_ratio=0.2)
print(summary)

Replace 'path_to_your_text_file.txt' with the actual path to your text file. The summary_ratio can be adjusted as needed to get the desired level of summary detail.
